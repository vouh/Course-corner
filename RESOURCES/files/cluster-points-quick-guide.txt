Course Corner — Cluster Points Quick Guide

- Cluster points are calculated from a set of subjects required by a course cluster.
- Different course clusters use different subject combinations.
- Your cluster points can be higher than your overall points depending on your strengths.

Tip: Use the calculator page to estimate your points, then compare against past cut-offs where available.
